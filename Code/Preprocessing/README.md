An RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors in parallel;

Steps to execute for first time:

Note: In order to have a clean environment it is required to delete the files in preprocesed_data and relexicalised_predictions folders

1. To procced with the preprocessing execute the following command:
   python webnlg_baseline_input.py -i data-directory/
2. Cut all the files generated by the script and paste them in preprocessed_data folder 
   (dev-*.txt, dev-*.lex, dev-*.triple, rplc_*.json, train-*.lex, train-*.triple, unseen-*.txt, unseen-*.lex, unseen-*.triple)
3. Now it is possible to run the baseline (Instructions in SP-SYNTAX-PAR/Code/Baseline/OpenNMT-py)
4. Once the baseline has been executed, the relexicalisation can be perfomed:
   python multiple_relexicalisation.py
5. Now the evaluation can be performed. The instructions in SP-SYNTAX-PAR/Code/Evaluation
